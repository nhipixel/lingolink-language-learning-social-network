# LingoLink – Interactive Language Exchange Social Platform Through Real-Time Communication *･゜ﾟ･*☆

LingoLink is a personal project inspired by my passion for educational technology and my belief in making immersive, accessible learning available to everyone — especially those who can't afford traditional language classes or don't have access to in-person opportunities. It’s designed to help people find study partners and language buddies from anywhere in the world, encouraging real-time conversation as a powerful way to learn beyond classrooms and borders.

The platform includes live messaging, 1-on-1 and group video calls with livestreaming options for study buddies, JWT-based authentication, and various dynamic UI themes. Built with scalability and user experience in mind, LingoLink is a hands-on experiment in modern EdTech.
